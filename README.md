# Shiny-Dashboard

```
Hr Reporting Dashboards with ShinyR
```


##### Not everyone wants to go through the process of building visualizations, since creating reports from newly generated data can be strenous. R offers a wide range of possibilies of automating visualizations such that with the click of a button, HR's can assess KPI's for the month. 


##### What's more interesting is that this there are possibilities of visualizing data in real time, create not just the regular static plots but also Html widgets and interactive plots using the plotly, leaflet and some other libraries.



##### For this work we use an HR data downloaded and we generate a dashboard, after generating the plot with a shortline of code you can deploy you webapp to a server. For the Shiny server just write rsconnect::shinyApp(Appname = ), at the end of you code and then deploy to a service where anyone with the link can view the results of the automated processes
